Images are on purpose doubled just to show reinfection rates too, but this note is to highlight that mortality rates can't be estimated from the plot (they will be too low - people can be re-infected, but they can't re-pass). The mortality rates can be seen from the code, and the population size allows for roughly those rates to materialise in the simulation (given random element).
